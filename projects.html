    <p> Welcome to my website! I am a journalist specialized in social media and audience strategy studying at the University of Missouri- Columbia. I am equipped in understanding social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Facebook. I am also able to utilize analytics from a brand or newsroomâ€™s website and social media accounts and apply SEO to reach audiences, old and new. </p>

    <p>I like to stay up to date with trends and am eager to create new, innovative social media posts while using inside data to maximize what brands/newsrooms receive from being online.</p>

    <p>Currently looking for an internship summer 2022 to expand my experience and exercise new skills that allow people to effectively tell their stories and help brands thrive online.</p>
